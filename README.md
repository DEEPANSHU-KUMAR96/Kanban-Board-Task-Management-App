:- Features

✅ Drag & Drop Task Movement

Move tasks between columns (To Do → Progress → Done) easily using drag events.

✅ Add New Tasks

A modal popup lets you create new tasks with a title and description.

✅ Delete Tasks

Each task includes a delete button to remove it instantly.

✅ Real-Time Task Count

Each column automatically displays the number of tasks inside it.

✅ LocalStorage Persistence
All tasks stay saved — even after page reload:
Task titles & descriptions
Task positions (which column they were in)

✅ Responsive UI
Clean, modern, and responsive layout made using CSS.

🧠 How It Works:-

Each task is a draggable card (.task).
Columns listen for dragenter, dragover, drop events.

On drop:
⭐ Task is appended to the column
⭐ Task counts are updated
⭐ Data is saved in localStorage
⭐ Modal allows adding tasks dynamically.
⭐ All tasks reload on page refresh using saved data.
